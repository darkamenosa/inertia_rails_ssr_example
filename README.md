# README

I’ve never been great at CSS or front-end styling, so I lean on frameworks to pick up the slack. Back in the day, Bootstrap plus a good theme was all I needed. Lately, though, the community has drifted toward Tailwind CSS, and high-quality Bootstrap themes have become harder to find.

While looking for a modern alternative, I stumbled onto **shadcn UI** paired with **v0.dev**—an amazingly productive combo for generating slick UIs. The catch? Their output is pure React and TypeScript, which doesn’t mesh with Rails’ Hotwire-first philosophy (HTML over the wire).

That realization pushed me down a different path: I spun up a **FastAPI** back end (great for AI-related libraries) and used **Next.js** plus v0.dev for the front end. Development speed was insane—easily 10× faster than hand-rolling UI. The honeymoon ended on the server side, though: FastAPI was missing a lot of the batteries-included conveniences I’d taken for granted in Rails. Tasks that used to take hours in Rails stretched into days.

So I weighed my options:

1. **Rails API + Next.js**
2. **Next.js front end proxy with a Rails app for some urls** ([this “Flexile” repo](https://github.com/antiwork/flexile/))

Vercel’s unpredictable bills made me nervous about a pure Next.js deployment, and I normally host with **Hetzner** using **Kamal**. Something about the setup still felt off.

Friends suggested trying **Inertia.js** with Rails so I could reuse the shadcn UI components generated by v0.dev. My project needs server-side rendering (SSR) for marketing pages and rich client-side interactions inside the app itself. My first idea: use Rails + Hotwire for SSR pages, then switch to Inertia for the complex parts. Reality check:

* How can I share UI CSS between two build pipelines. (Yes, you can build Hotwire with Vite and don't use importmap)
* v0.dev stopped generating static HTML—I’d be stuck copy-pasting and tweaking markup by hand.
* Keeping two very different mental models (Hotwire and Inertia) alive at once felt exhausting.

The epiphany came when I realized **Inertia now supports SSR**. Goodbye, Hotwire split-brain; hello single-stack Rails + Inertia.

That’s when the real headaches began. Nearly every tutorial I found was three years old, the docs were confusing and incomplete, and most SSR examples were nothing more than abandoned placeholders. Add Kamal’s quirky deployment steps on top, and I spent an entire week digging through repos just to get things working.

To spare you that pain, I documented the whole process:

* **Step-by-step tutorial:** [Tutorial](https://tuyenhx.com/blog/inertia-rails-shadcn-typescript-ssr-en/)
* **Sample code repo:** [This repo](https://github.com/darkamenosa/inertia_rails_ssr_example)

Hope it saves you a ton of time—happy hacking!
